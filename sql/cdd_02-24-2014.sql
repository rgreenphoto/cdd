Our other dog Bella, discovered her huddled and disheartened against the Petsmart wall. She was a bag of bones trying to disappear into that wall. For whatever reason, Bella raised her ears toward her and Aires raised her ears back, thats when we noticed another Bat Dog. And after some discussion, we adopted her. Sadly she was severely malnourished she came to us under 25lbs, her playing weight is 45lbs, and having never been let out she do not know how to run, she hopped like a deer. Like many abused dogs, she had both mental and physical issues that were almost too much for us but thankfully, we stuck it out and she has turned into an amazing frisbee dog. However, the abusive experience has haunted her for many years so if you try to say "hello" and she slinks away, don''t take it personally.\nAs for her acomplishments, Aires is a combination 5 time world qualifier in both Skyhoundz and UFO All Stars. She only played in one UfO All Star because of a career ending injury. She''s never won at that level but we blame the humans that choke at the line for that. She''s won local toss and catch, a few majors and gained some Hardware in the Quadraped. But her greatest accomplishment is rising above her past and playing her best at all times and being a great companion.', 1, '7_IMG_0477.jpg', 0, '2013-03-10 20:54:02', 1, '2013-06-09 01:13:02', 300, 0),

She was the pick of the litter, I say this because well, I choose her and she was the 1st to go. I had never owned a herding dog let alone a high drive puppy from working parents and I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into. Bella''s 1st job was rearranging my house and making a small hole in the carpet much, much bigger. As it turned out, my husband found the perfect job for her thru smoking. Reuben, my then would be husband, smoked outside because smoking isn''t allowed in my house. So rain or shine, -25 or white out blizzard Reuben was outside smoking. Bella often joined him bringing a toy with her. Just to keep warm he would toss it and Bella got to be pretty good. Good enough that we found frisbee competitions on the internet. We did a few locals, then branched out and were sold onto the sport. Bella brought us here, to Colorado and the CDD. At first we thought these CDD people are a little weird and really into their dogs. I am now proud to say, we a little weird and really into our dogs too. Bella''s career winnings is neither long nor distinguished although she did win one Skyhoundz Western Open division freestyle and D/A in the Masters division. However to me, she was the best frisbee dog because she taught me how to be part of a team, the importance of learning how to throw and most of all, she humbled me with her sacrifices. She brought me to the world of Disc Dog and I am a better human, dog owner and trainer because she came into my life. I will be forever grateful to my Bella Bella.

Together, they learned how to play the game, and on the way managed to accumulate quite a lot of recognition for their accomplishments. In 2000,  Laika became the first dog from Colorado to qualify for the World Championships. That year, they also became the first team from Colorado to win a National Championship, when they won the Quadruped Long Distance series. Their winning ways spanned many years, with appearances on television, national and world records set, and travel all over the USA, and even trips to perform in Europe!\r\nSadly, Laika left us in 2009, just after turning 14 years old. She left behind a legacy of wonder, excitement and inspiration. She was immortalized as the logo dog in the Colorado Disc Dogs logo. \r\nHere is a great video of Laika:\r\n<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0DRyAFJ0ROM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 1, '67_LaikaSLC.jpg', 0, '2013-03-10 20:54:03', 1, '2013-05-02 18:38:24', 234, 0),

I felt like I knew him before we ever met. He was a little red dog with big ears and a big bark, slightly cow-hocked and the most beautiful flying trot I have ever seen, before or since. He was my foster dog for all of 3 minutes. We were destined to be together.<br /><br />The first time I threw a frisbee for him, he stood at my side and watched it fall, then looked at me with a quizzical "why did you throw that?" look. The second time I threw a frisbee for him, he ran out 25 yards and flew through the air with that incredible hang time that was his trademark... like michael jordan with fur... just hanging in the air like a bird, before grabbing that disc and landing lightly on his feet. I had chills just watching that first catch, and that feeling of awe and amazement never dimmed as we played frisbee together all over the world for the next decade.<br /><br />I don''t know why we get the dogs we do. I just know how incredibly blessed I was to have him in my life, and how much I will miss him for the rest of my days.

Pam and Shadow were inseprable from the moment she saw him and Shadow was bonded as soon as Pam picked him up.  Shadow started us down this enjoyable sport of Dogs and Discs one day at the dog park with my wife.  Shadow picked up a Frisbee and we got hooked very quickly.  Shadow''s accomplishments include a Gold medal at 2011 Colorado Canine Challenge in his second year in the Intermediate division T&C and several medals (two silver and one bronze) in the Advanced division T&C.  Shadow also qualified for UFO World Finals in distance in 2012 held in Florida.  What a wonderful experience!

It''s quite a funny story of how we came to have Marley in our lives. We were out shopping for office furniture and there was a Wag -N-Wash next door that had puppies for adoption. So we decided to take a look and just fell in love with him. With this being our 1st dog as adults, we only sort of had an idea of what we were getting into. We new we had to find him a job to do. That''s when we discovered the CDD. Marley''s accomplishments are "Rookie of the Year Award" two years in row. In 2009 he won with Brian and in 2010 he won with me, Making him only the second dog in club history to accomplish that. He has made it possible for us to meet some wonderful, crazy disc dog people and have exposed us to a whole new world. I am sooo great full that he picked us to be his companion. Marley has taught me many things over the years, but most all he has taught me to live in the moment. That lesson alone has been the best motto to live by. Marley is a workaholic at catching flyin'' discs and a piggy when it comes to treats. Hope you will all get a chance to come and see this wonderfully, obsessed dog perform at shows and competitions.', 1, '692_IMG_1231.2_.jpg', 0, '2013-03-10 20:54:11', 1, '2013-04-03 22:27:45', 333, 0),

She believes this because she found me in the same place as her Aussie Patches who had who had passed away over ten years ago.  However, Patches was in a box outside the store, before it was a pet store in 1990.  Since her passing Mom did not have the heart to love another Aussie, but of course I stole her heart. So now it is a happier life for both of us. I have always been highly intelligent,it only took mere weeks before I aced my obedience training with Tami at American Dog School ( I am her favorite no matter what Amadeus thinks)  But lets get serious and talk about Frisbees. My mom she thinks Frisbee is about dancing around the field and throwing my Frisbees randomly about the field. I love her, so I indulge her. But lets set the record straight, I believe that Frisbees were meant to be thrown very long distances, and it is my job to chase it down and bring it back. I am certain of this today as I was the first time I had a Frisbee in my mouth. That is Dads job and we are a symbiotic team. I know his moves, and listen to him very carefully every time we are on the line. I love it! So if you want hang out and "play" go hang with my brother-but if your a true competitor beware because I am stealth, you will not see me coming and you can eat my dust as I go by!

It was definitely a challenge for us, to bring her out of her shell. We learned calm and patience from her, and she learned that the world really wasn''t so scary. Being a part of the CDD, we had a whole big wonderful family to help us with her rehabilitation. Last year was the first true year that we all got to see her truly wonderful goofy personality. She just loves to have fun and make everyone around her giggle like crazy. Her favorite trick is to pick up as many discs as possible. Her record is 12 discs at once. She has gained the nickname "anaconda". She is the most fun, lovable and goofy little girl you''ll ever meet.

Reuben picked him out from a cage as he was tossing younger puppies out of the feeding plate. He named him Sammy and I knew he was ours. As we were driving home, I picked up this football of a puppy, looked at him and said "I don''t care what he calls you, your name is Bubba", Bubba has little play drive, non athletic confirmation and is content to chew on a bone and even though he''s an indoor dog he prefers to be outside in the sun, rain or snow. Bubba is sweet as rain, balances my high drive pack and is abit dopey. Thats not an insult, its a statement of fact and is one of his many endearing qualities. At one time I thought he had nothing going on between his tiny ears but then I realized he gets a warm bed, premium dog food and gets to travel around the nation in an RV and even has his own place in the RV called Bubba Land. He gets everything those hard working frisbee dogs get and all he has to do is chew bones in the back yard, roll over for belly rubs and wander around sniffing on hikes and trips to the park. He''s not dumb, he''s the smartest one in the pack. When you meet Bubba, you will love him and he will love you. We are pretty sure Bubba came off the Crow reservation and is a Rez dog. The Rez dog tale can be sad, unaltered dogs roaming free, breeding unscrupulously, subjected to disease, illness and injury, often forced to eat whatever. Some lucky ones have a home but many do not. The one quality most Rez dogs share is they are often gentle toward humans because an aggressive free roaming dog on the Rez is simply shot on sight. So the Rez Dog is gentle toward people, hardy and their pedigrees are mixed with everything under the sun. Bubba''s one accomplishment has nothing to do with frisbee but saving a young girl. My god child, Ashlyn, had taken him to a local park near her house where she climbed a tree. She fell 15 to 20 feet hitting several branches that knocked her unconscious and the wind out her when she woke up, leaving her unable to call for help. Bubba ran to the nearest person and began barking and hopping until they followed him to where she lay in the tall grass. No one would have seen her without his help.

On Sunday June 16<sup>th</sup>, the Colorado Disc Dogs deliver. Come try your hand at a variety of disc games that are planned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Mini Distance</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first event of the day is a throw back event honoring the old Lyons format. For those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar with this format this is a true Mini Distance Toss and Catch event.&nbsp; Like usual, teams will have 60 seconds to get as many throws off as possible. The main difference here is the size of the field. We will be using a field that is only 20 yards long. So if you ever thought, jeez I can&rsquo;t compete against the teams that can sniper the long throws, this is your chance to level the playing field.</p>\n<p>The scoring zones are as follows:</p>\n<p>0-5 yards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 points</p>\n<p>5-10 yards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 point</p>\n<p>10-15 yards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 points</p>\n<p>15-20 yards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 points</p>\n<p>20+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 points</p>\n<p>All four paws must be across the line to score in the higher zone and an extra &frac12; point will be awarded for all four paws in the air.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>NOBA Mini Distance</h4>\n<p>For this event we&rsquo;ve put a twist on the Mini Distance format. The rules are the same as above with a few minor differences. There will be NO BAckhand throws allowed and NO repeat throws. Handlers must use a different throw each time. No backhands apply to both the right and left hand, however all other throws can be done using either hand to count as a different throw. So break out those scoobers, thumbers, tomahawks, and any other throw you can think of.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Long Distance</h4>\n<p>You say you want to throw long. This is your chance to shine. For this event we will be using a format similar to the UFO Longshot. All teams will start out throwing in order form 40 yards out. The catch must be made across the catching line (where the front feet touch down during the catch, or after the line, if caught in mid-air).&nbsp; Each team that successfully completes a catch will move up to the next distance. If your dog makes the catch across the catching line, you stay in. Each miss counts as a strike. Each team has 3 misses for the whole game. A throw will be scored a miss if they miss the catch OR if they miss the distance (ie, the catch is NOT across the catch line). If a team misses, they IMMEDIATELY make a second try. Misses are cumulative, so if you miss once at one distance, that miss WILL count against you if you miss a second time a longer distance. Once a team gets their 3rd miss, they are out. This will continue until there is only one team left, our winners</p>\n<p>The progression of distance is expected to increase by 5 yards for each successive round but may change depending on if we run into time constraints.</p>\n<p>For all events there are only two divisions. The playing division and the Spectators. Second rounds for each event will be determined &ldquo;day of&rdquo; based on the number of teams competing and available time. Spectators will be able to enjoy watching disc dog action.</p>\n<p>Registration will be from 7:30-8:30. The competition will begin at 9am.</p>\n<p>Registration for the events above is $5.00 per team per event. You can choose to play just your favorite event or give em all a try.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Mini Disc 50/50 Skill Shot</h4>\n<p>As an added bonus you can also try your hand at the Mini Disc 50/50 Skill shot. For this you&rsquo;ll need to purchase a mini disc at registration. Before lunch we&rsquo;ll give the dogs a break and see who can sink a shot with the mini&rsquo;s in a disc golf basket. All throws must be made from behind the flags surrounding the field. So get there early to pick a prime spot or start making friends with people in prime spots. The winner splits the pot. If there is more than one basket made, we will hold a shoot out from increasing distances. If no one makes the basket, the closet disc to the center of the basket wins.</p>\n<p>Mini-Discs and a chance at the prize can be purchased for $2/per disc or 3 discs for $5. Make sure to put you name on the disc. Discs with no names will not count towards the prize. Winners will be announced after the Long distance event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For those that are competing on Saturday, tents can be left on site over night. There will be security for the festival, however it is recommended that all valuables be removed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For questions, contact Brian White at bobo-n-koko@comcast.net</p>', '', '', '', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, NULL, '2013-06-06', '2013-06-13', 1, 'spring-spree-mix-up-06-16-2013', '2013-05-05 21:30:50', 334, '2013-09-28 12:50:44', NULL, 0),

These events are often sanctioned by a national or international frisbee dog governing body, and thus our events are run using the freestyle and minidistance rules of that particular organization. For events that are not nationally sanctioned, the club will usually elect to use the rules of one of the major organizations, usually the<a title="UFO" href="http://www.ufoworldcup.org/" target="_blank"> UFO</a> or <a title="skyhoundz" href="http://skyhoundz.com" target="_blank">Skyhoundz</a>. While similar, there are small differences between the two that should be understood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Clicking the links above for the above mentioned organizations will take you to their homepage, where you can learn the rules and guidelines you should know for each. A <a href="http://www.ufoworldcup.org/" target="_blank">UFO </a>Major, a <a href="http://skyhoundz.com" target="_blank">Skyhoundz</a> Open Regional, an <a href="http://www.ashleywhippet.com/" target="_blank">AWI</a> Qualifier and The <a title="quadruped" href="http://www.thequadruped.com" target="_blank">Quadruped</a> also usually make stops in Colorado each season, and these events are run by the organizers rules. Please see their official sites for more information. For newcomers, playdays are a great place to get help with the various organization''s rules, as is Spring Training!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, The Colorado Disc Dogs have a general set of rules for our events. In order for our events to run smoothly, we ask that everyone observe these basic disc dog etiquette guidelines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Basic Guidelines for Competition</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your dog on a leash at all times when you are not competing or warming up. This saves you the embarrassment of having your dog run onto the field and interrupting the competition.</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Not all dogs, even well socialized ones, appreciate having other dogs in their space. Please be aware of what your dog is doing at the end of your 16-foot flexi-lead.</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Always pick up after your dog, and remind others to do the same. We try very hard to maintain good relations with the communities that allow us to host our events in their areas, and this is the main way we show our gratitude. Always leave the event site cleaner than you found it!</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">As a courtesy to competitors, no food or treats of any kind are allowed on the competition field. Food dropped on the playing field may cause unnecessary distractions.</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Please exhibit good sportsmanship. This is a family sport, and we want our kids to be able to look up to you. Set a good example.</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NO</strong> female dogs in heat allowed at the competition site.</li>\n<li style="text-align: justify;">Please treat your dog with respect. At the discretion of the contest coordinator, competitors who are seen to be mistreating their dogs will be asked to leave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Division Guidelines</strong></span></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the events run by the Colorado Disc Dogs will have four (4) divisions. The following information should help you figure out which division you and your dog should enter. And as always, the staff at the event will gladly answer any questions regarding format or which division you belong. These divisions constitute the "format" of our events. At the Skyhoundz Regional and the UFO Major, the rules for those events will take precedence, so the number and names of the divisions may change. Please see the appropriate organizer''s website to determine the format for our "big"events.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The four divisions that the CDD will offer at its events are: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Open. On some occasions, a non-competitive Recreational division may be offered as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Novice Division:</strong> The novice division has been, and will continue to be, a division for people new to the sport. However, people progress at different rates when they start going to competitions -- some people improve quickly, and others get better more gradually -- and the club recognizes this. To that end, we allow new teams to remain in the Novice division for two years. During their first year (365-day rule), a novice team may remain in the division no matter what results they put up. However, during their second year, if a team competing in Novice earns two "Top 3" finishes, they must immediately move up to a higher division.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It should be noted that new teams are not required to stay in Novice. They can move up into other divisions at ANY time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">(Note: The Rookie of the Year prize is still only for teams competing in their first SEASON, and the cut-off is still January 1. If you''ve competed prior to Jan. 1, with any dog, in any Frisbee event, you are NOT eligible for Rookie of the Year.)</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Novice competitors will compete in two rounds* of Mini-Distance (also called Distance/Accuracy or Throw &amp; Catch) getting 60 seconds in each round to make as many throws for their dog as possible using a single disc. Points are awarded for catches based on length of throw and whether the dog was in the air at the time of the catch. Upon registration, all novice competitors will receive an official disc. Novice competitors may then use this disc or most any other safe disc in competition, including floppies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intermediate Division:</strong> The Intermediate Division is for experienced teams who have been involved in the sport for more than a year (365 days), but are not ready for the Advanced Division yet. Intermediate competitors will compete in the same Mini-Distance format mentioned above. Intermediate competitors must use a standard competition disc (Wham-O Fastback Frisbee, Hero 235, Dogstar, or HyperFlite). Some events do provide 1 disc at sign-up, but competitors at this level and above need to provide their own discs. Official club discs will be available for sale at competitions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Division:</strong> The Advanced Division is for the top MiniDistance teams. These teams are generally very experienced, but the division is open to anyone.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open Division:</strong> The Open Division is for the most experienced teams and consists of one round of Mini-Distance and one round of Freestyle.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Teams entered in the open division will typically complete their MiniDistance round with the first round of Advanced Division.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;">Freestyle consists of a choreographed routine with your dog set to music, utilizing multiple discs and any and every type of throw and trick you can think of. Teams are typically allowed 90 seconds (Skyhoundz) or 120 seconds (UFO) to perform. This is where you routinely see vaults off the back, flips, spins, jumps, rolls, weaves, and many other amazing moves. Please see the official rules for either the UFO or Skyhoundz. New freestylers are always welcome, so if you think you can put on a good show, please don''t hesitate to give it a try! Open competitors are also required to supply their own competition standard discs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dual Entry:</strong> Advanced and Open-For these 2 divisions only, it is allowed for a competitor to enter both divisions with the same dog. The 1st round of MiniDistance in the Advanced division will count as the MiniDistance score in the Open division. Only teams that are "entered" into Advanced will have an opportunity to advance to a second round of MiniDistance. PLEASE BE AWARE OF YOUR DOG''S CONDITION AND THEIR LIMITS. Summer competitions can quickly wear out both humans and dogs. Only enter both divisions, or consider sharing your dog, if you know your dog can handle it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recreational Division:</strong> The Recreational Division is designed to be a non-competitive division, appealing to those who want to "just play" or perhaps gain a little more experience before trying a competition. The division is open to anyone, regardless of the experience level of handler or dog. There will only be a single 60 second Toss and Catch (MiniDistance) round for each team. The round will be scored according to the normal scoring rules for that event''s format (UFO or SkyHoundz), but the teams will NOT be ranked, nor will there be a final standings posted, or prizes awarded. Upon request, competitors will receive a copy of their score sheet following the event, but it will not contain any final standings information. Since there are no standings, teams in the Rec Division will NOT earn Colorado Cup points.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">* Depending on the number of teams registered in each division, the availability of enough space to run a second field, and whether there are enough qualified volunteers to run the second field, the event organizers may run a second field, or decide to limit participation in the Second Round to the top finishers of Round One. This decision will be made once registration is complete and announced prior to the beginning of Round One.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Good luck this season!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>', 'rules', NULL, NULL, 0, '2013-02-10 14:20:30', 1, '2013-04-15 14:47:58', 334, 0);

(13, 0, 'History', '<p>Welcome to the online home of the Colorado Disc Dogs!</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Early History of Disc Dog Sport</strong></span></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Who threw the first frisbee to a dog? Very likely Fred Morrison, or an employee of Wham-o; as soon as plastic discs left their molds, dogs knew exactly what to do with them! Although we may never know the ''first'' frisbee dog, we know the dogs that put the sport on the map, and their owners who created the competitions that are still running today!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1974, 50,000 spectators at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles jumped to their feet and cheered when an uninvited canine athlete named Ashley Whippet ran 35 miles an hour, leaped nine feet in the air, and caught Frisbee discs from his owner Alex Stein for eight uninterrupted minutes between innings. But neither that audience, nor the millions watching the pennant-crucial game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds on television, could have predicted they were witnessing the birth of a canine competition that would soon thrill legions of dog lovers throughout the world. Ashley''s national stadium debut was engineered by his owner Alex Stein, then a student at Ohio State. When Hollywood talent scouts failed to return Stein''s calls, he took matters into his own hands and smuggled Ashley into Dodger Stadium on the evening of August 4, 1974. Ashley went on to break all records, winning the Canine Frisbee Disc World Championships three times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<img style="float: left; border: 0; margin: 5px;"

with Stein on such television programs as: "Wide World of Sports," "Good Morning America," "The Tonight Show," and others. He entertained at practically every NFL and Major League Baseball stadium in the United States and Canada, and starred in "Floating Free" -- a film documentary nominated for an Academy Award.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Before Ashley showed up in Southern California, there was already a frisbee catching dog movement in its early stages. The main innovator behind this new application of frisbee was a man named Eldon McIntire. Eldon was a dog trainer and a frisbee afficianado, and it didn''t take long for him to see how the disc sparked the interest of his dog, Hyper Hank. Hank was an Australian Shepherd, and Eldon began refining techniques of throw &amp; catch with Hank that challenged Hank''s tracking abilities. The ''sport'' was in the early development stage when Ashley exploded on the scene. Inspired by the event, Eldon McIntire contacted a local radio show to make them aware of this growing phenomenon. The radio station responded by organizing the first ever frisbee dog competition, "The Fearless Fido Frisbee Fetching Fracas"! This Classic event represented the beginning of the competitive aspect of the sport.

and Eldon performed for an audience of nearly 1 billion people world-wide.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Eldon and Alex, with Hank and Ashley, travelled and performed for many years. Along with Whamo promoter and PR genius Irv Lander, they created the sport of canine disc, and managed the competitions for many years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>History of the Colorado Disc Dogs</strong></span></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There were certainly dogs catching frisbees in Colorado prior to the early 90''s, and there were even competitions being run in some cities. Posters from the 1984 Rocky Mountain Frisbee Championships even advertised frisbee dog demonstrations. But until 1994, there was no organized club to promote the sport and introduce new people to this great pasttime. In 1993, Californian Rick Brydum loaded up his family and came out to the Rockies. Rick found no clubs, and very few competitions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Rick Brydum''s frisbee dog interest and abilities were honed in the ''80''s Southern California frisbee dog scene. Regularly competing with the likes of Lou McCammon, Gary Suzuki, Bill Watters, Gary Gomes, Reed Ferguson, and other folks, Rick was in the thick of the sport at its very epicenter. Rick and his two Aussies, Sean and Sasha, were excellent competitors -- multitime regional finalists. Rick''s frisbee dogs appeared in a Japanese shoe commercial, and Rick and Sean eventually won the Pacific Coast Championship. These two amazing Aussies were also one of the first "double dog" teams around! Rick brought all this experience and enthusiasm to Colorado in 1993, and in 1994, started the state''s first frisbee dog club, the Front Range Flyers K9 Disc Club.</p>\n<p style="text-align:

alt="" width="279" height="189" />Around the same time, another Californian refugee and his family moved to Colorado. Glen Medford brought a mess of freestyle tricks and a lot of willingness to help out and teach the younger generations starting off in Colorado. Glen''s dog Brittany had traveled the world catching frisbees, and even appeared in a Sunkist ad. Glen was very influential to the first "native" Colorado Frisbee dog freestylers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Rick shortly adopted another great Aussie, Barney, and with a new club and an itch to make something happen in the state, Rick contacted Irv Lander, the executive director of the Ashley Whippet Invitational, and co-founder of the sport. Rick told Irv there was not much here, but lots of potential. Irv was excited to have a local contact in Colorado, as they had wanted to put an event in the Denver area for some time. Rick and Irv worked together, and the result was one of the most famous and formidable contests to ever run -- The Open Regional.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time, the disc dog world consisted of the Ashley Whippet World Championships, owned and operated by Ashley Whippet Enterprises (AWE). AWE events consisted of several regional contests. The top two competitors from each would earn a trip to the World Championships. The Open Regional was conceived as a "last chance" regional to earn two of those World Championship berths. The first Open took place in 1994, at Dove Valley Park, across from the Denver Broncos training center. Nearly 100 teams showed up -- the cream of the frisbee dog crop! The event continued through 1997. In 1998, it was split into 2 regionals, an east and a west, held on their respective coasts. The success of the Open regional spawned the Colorado Canine Challenge, which was first held in 1998. The CCC continues the tradition of top flight frisbee dogs gathering to establish the top dog!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As Rick was helping to establish some new competitions in the state, his work had enough of an influence to cause a second Colorado club to come into existence. In early 1996, in the frisbee-saturated Ft. Collins area, Chris Sexton, Liz Brennfleck and Todd Stevens started the Northern Colorado Disc Dogs. This club was a smaller, regional club, hosting the Ft. Collins competition and regular playdays.

alt="" width="172" height="216" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To the south of Denver, another of Rick''s proteges, Rob Provost, was building a contest of his own. The Colorado Springs scene grew largely out of Rob''s efforts in that city, both in demos and at his heavily attended contest. Rob''s dog Hershey would prove to be one of the most consistent and excellent MiniDistance frisbee dogs around, and was the inspiration for the Club''s annual "Hershey Memorial Award," given to the team with the highest MiniDistance score of the year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Rick, Rob, Chris and Todd worked together to run great contests, and very soon, club resources were combined. The two clubs ran as one entity, and in early 1999, the last vestiges of 2 separate clubs were retired. The new club name was unveiled -- The Colorado Disc Dogs. A killer logo and more contests and shows than ever made Colorado a frisbee dog hotspot, and it continues to be today.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, Rick and Chris still are still actively involved with club, along with a ton of support from many club members. The Colorado State Championship Series, which awards the Colorado Cup to the State Champ each year, was started in 1997. The series continues today, with a Rookie of the year recognized each year as well. Playing host to prestigious events like the FDDO, The Quadruped, and World Cup events, Colorado will be in the fast lane for frisbee dog action for a long time to come!&nbsp;</p>', 'history', NULL, NULL, 0, '2013-02-10 14:23:51', 1, '2013-04-01 02:23:55', 334, 0);

(14, 0, 'Sponsorship', '<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Individual Sponsorship and the CDD</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sponsorship has long been a part of the sport of canine frisbee. The earliest events had support from Wham-o, and shortly thereafter, Kal-Kan, thus beginning a long line of dog food sponsors.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the departure of the last "big" sponsor of the sport, Alpo, at the end of the 2000 season, we have seen various events and organizations "open up" their fields to individual sponsorship. Similarly, we have seen many teams get sponsored in many different capacities. Where it is allowed, this can be a great benefit to both the sponsor and the individual team.The CDD would like to make sure that the environment that we offer people to play in is sponsor-friendly. Both for our event sponsors and for any individual sponsors that may teams may bring in.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To that end, here is a list of what the CDD guidelines for sponsorship are. If there are any problems with this list, you can address them (politely!) on the club list, or you can email the officers privately, and they will try to answer your question. If you come up with something that this list does not address, feel free to make it known to the officers, and we will see if we need to address it, or if it is beyond the scope of this project.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With all the below provisions, it SHOULD go without saying that ANY clothing or banners, sponsored or not, be in good taste for public, family friendly events!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At club-run competitions:</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clothing</strong>-The CDD allows competitors to wear any and all sponsor logo-ed hats, shirts, shorts, socks, shoes that they like. Any vests or coats on the dogs may also display a sponsor logo. There are no restrictions here, although competitors may read the rules regarding "Costumes" at website for the national organizers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Historically, some event organizers have asked that all competitors wear an event t-shirt. If an event with this requirement is taking place under the direct administration of the CDD, it will be up to the national organizer, not the club, to make this known and enforce it.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tents</strong>-branded tents (not banners) are allowed at club-run events. However, in some cases, the club may ask that the tent not be placed immediately next to the field. This would only be in the event that a conflicting sponsor is sponsoring the event. If there are any questions, check with a club officer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Banners</strong>-Competitors can hang any sponsor banners they like at the back of their tent. If a team wants to put a banner on the front of their tent, they will need to check with the club. The only situation where we might ask that a banner be moved to the rear of a competitor''s tent is if a conflicting sponsor is sponsoring the event. If there are any questions, check with a club officer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sponsor announcements</strong>-This warrants special mention. If a sponsored competitors would like the club to announce their sponsors as they come on to the field for their round, the announcer MIGHT be able to do this. This is ABSOLUTELY NOT GUARANTEED. With the hectic pace of a CDD event, the large number of competitors, and many people doing more than one job, we can tell you that we will try to make the announcement as you take the field. This will be entirely up to the discretion of the Announcer. The competitor MUST supply this information to the announcer, and please keep it VERY brief. Though we have a little bit of time between competitors, we want to avoid unnecessary delays. Also keep in mind that we often have other important things to announce, and event sponsors are guaranteed PA placements, so the time between competitors may be already taken. But we will give it our best shot!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Individual sponsorship at club demos</strong>-</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At demos that the club performs at, we will need to maintain a professional appearance, and we will ask anyone performing to please wear the provided demo team shirt. Teams participating in demos need to remember that the demo is NOT a place to promote your own individual sponsors, and in some circumstances the club may actually be getting paid and an individual sponsor may be inappropriate. If there are any questions, check with our Demo coordinator. We do want to say that we believe that performing with the CDD demo team is a great experience, and if you need to cite your experience with the team for the purposes of obtaining sponsorship, please do so!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope this serves as a good guide for our sponsored teams.</p>', 'sponsorship', NULL, NULL, 0, '2013-02-11 23:43:34', 1, '2013-02-24 14:27:15', 1, 0),

I have also been a trainer and started a therapy dog program, where I work at a community mental health center in Durango. I am currently studying to be a licensed social worker with an animal assisted therapy certificate and both my dogs are certified as therapy dogs with Therapy Dogs International. \n\nI am so glad we found this sport and this club, because it''s an awesome group of people and we had so much fun during our first year in 2012 and can''t wait for the 2013 season!

We took home the Rookie Award in 2010. This was Marley''s 2nd Rookie Award. In 2009 he and my husband Brian won. Finding Colorado Disc Dogs has completely changed my life, both mentally and physically. Joining this Club, of like minded people, has been a God send for me. In 2009 I went through a major life change due to a lengthy back surgery and recovery.  Being a part of an extraordinary, extended Family (CDD), has been the best thing that I could have ever asked for. In the fall of 2011 I was blessed with Keva, she had some issues with trust and was very shy about everything when we rescued her.  After working very hard with her and with the help of the CDD, she has turned into a wonderful goofy girl. She always makes me laugh, therefore her nickname "Ms. McGiggles". Last year (2012) was Keva''s and my year to start performing on the CDD Demo Team. Keva has brought a very special show stopper trick, in that she loves to pick up as many discs as possible, her current record is 12 which she achieved at Estes Highlands Festival. I also currently hold the Club''s executive position of Secretary. This is my first season as an officer. I hope I can do as good of a job as the people have before me and be able to bring more high flyin'' fun to the residents of Colorado. I am very much looking forward to the 2013 season.

Granted before I even moved in I began my search. One day, at work I was looking at the available pets on <a href="http://ddfl.org" target="_blank">Denver Dumb Friends League</a> and saw a photo that changed my world. That afternoon, I took off early from work and me Mariah. A timid aussie mix that needed a good home. I fell in love from moment one. It took Mariah a couple of days. Bless her heart, the counselor at DDFL was very determined to make sure Mariah went to a good home. I spent a couple of hours convincing her she''d be OK with me that we''d get involved in a sport. \n\nLuckily for all of us, I won the counselor over! Mariah came home with me and made me the luckiest person alive. \n\nA few short months later, Mariah and I participated in the DDFL Furry Scurry. We also happened to see the Colorado Disc Dogs in action. We literally ''scurried'' over to the CDD info booth.
