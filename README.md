Disc Dogs Member and Score Manager
===

This system is being developed for use by Disc Dog Clubs. Designed to be a member management, score keep and content management system.
Currently pre-configured to handle UFO, Skyhoundz and AWI competition configurations for score keeping. A basic multi-group based authentication system allows for 
non-members to create account and register for events. Members can do all that plus additional member benefits like Profiles, complete score and registration history.

Admin users have access to the CMS and will generally belong to both Admin and Member groups. 


All graphic assets and custom CSS is for use by the Colorado Disc Dogs. Please switch out any photos or content prior to using. They're currently left in because the project was started speficially for one club, but want to normalize it.
